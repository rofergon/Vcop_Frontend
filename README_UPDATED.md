# VCOP Loan System

This document summarizes the changes made to the VCOP Lending system to modernize the implementation and improve compatibility with OnchainKit.

## Overview

The VCOP Loan system has been completely refactored to use OnchainKit's Transaction components for all blockchain interactions. The new implementation provides:

- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Better reusability of transaction utilities
- Improved user experience with standardized transaction components
- Modern React best practices

## Components

The refactored system consists of:

### 1. Transaction Utilities (`src/utils/transactionUtils.ts`)

Central location for all transaction-related functions, including:
- Contract call parameter encoding
- Transaction call generation for various contract functions
- Environmental configuration

### 2. Loan Creator (`src/components/loans/LoanCreator.tsx`)

Component for creating new collateralized positions:
- Deposit USDC collateral
- Mint VCOP tokens
- Configure utilization rate
- View collateralization ratio

### 3. Loan Manager (`src/components/loans/LoanManager.tsx`)

Component for managing existing loan positions:
- Add additional collateral
- Withdraw excess collateral
- Repay loan debt
- View position statistics

### 4. PSM Swapper (`src/components/loans/PSMSwapper.tsx`) 

Component for interacting with the Peg Stability Module:
- Buy VCOP with USDC
- Sell VCOP for USDC
- View PSM reserves and statistics

### 5. Loans Page (`src/pages/LoansPage.tsx`)

Main page component that integrates all loan-related components:
- Tab-based navigation between loan features
- Wallet connection handling
- Informational content

## Integration with OnchainKit

The implementation takes full advantage of OnchainKit's Transaction components:

- `<Transaction />`: Core component for managing the transaction lifecycle
- `<TransactionButton />`: UI component for initiating transactions 
- `<TransactionStatus />`: Shows transaction status
- `<TransactionToast />`: Displays toast notifications
- `<TransactionSponsor />`: Shows transaction gas sponsorship information

## Contract Interaction

The system interacts with the following smart contracts:

1. `VCOPCollateralManager`: Manages the loan positions, collateral, and minting
2. `VCOPCollateralHook`: Handles PSM operations and price stability mechanisms
3. `VCOPOracle`: Provides price data for VCOP and other assets
4. `VCOPCollateralized`: The VCOP token contract

## Benefits of the Refactoring

- **Better separation of concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
- **Improved code organization**: Transaction-related code centralized in utilities
- **Enhanced user experience**: Standardized transaction flow with better feedback
- **More maintainable**: Easier to update individual components
- **Better error handling**: Improved transaction error management through OnchainKit

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

- Adding liquidation management features
- Enhanced analytics dashboard
- Integration with DEX interfaces for VCOP trading
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
